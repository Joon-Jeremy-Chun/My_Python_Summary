# Variable
repeated or patterned data (or data types) can use efficiently by assign data on Variables. _The variables recode on Memory, so the process is not permanent_

## 1. Variable declaration and Assigning
1. The variable declaration has come first.

ex) A variable `a` is an integer.
```python
int a
```
2. After that assign data on the variable.

ex) Attach 10 to variable `a`
```python
a = 10
```
