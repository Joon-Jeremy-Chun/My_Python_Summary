# Variable
repeated or patterned data (or data types) can use efficiently by assign data on Variables. _The variables recode on Memory, so the process is not permanent_

## 1. Variable declaration and Assigning
1. The variable declaration has come first.

ex) A variable `a` is an integer.
```python
int a
```
2. After that assign data on the variable.

ex) Attach 10 to variable `a`
```python
a = 10
```

_`C` or `Java` has to declare variable but `python` or `R` otomatically known its variable type_

## 2. Several rules to nameing
+ Variable name only composed by `letters`,`numbers`, and `underscores(_)`.
+ No other symblics allows. _because it conflicts with other command logic_
+ Variable name cannot start with `numbers`.
+ There is differ in captial and small letters.
+ No space allows in the variable name. _because it conflicts program language order_ 
+ Can not use `Reserved word` as a variable.

# String `str`
